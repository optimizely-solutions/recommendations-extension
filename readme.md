# Update of the recommendations extension

Make it work without jquery, and on internet explorer (without polyfill).

It is also working in the visual editor (showing the exmaple JSON).

Currently still includes lots of console.logs, that I left in to understand what is happening. If you want to use this extension for a customer, then I would recommend to take most of these console.logs out.
