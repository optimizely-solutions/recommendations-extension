# Update of the recommendations extension

Make the recommendations extension work without jQuery.

It is also working in the visual editor (showing the example JSON).

Updated by Cooper: removed console.logs and added it into one log function you can turn on for debugging and turn off for production.

Updated by Simone: function for fetching and rendering recommendations.
